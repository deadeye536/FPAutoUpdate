Facepunch Auto-Update
=====================
This userscript will display a notification to the user when there is a new post to a currently opened thread.
  
[Install from Github](https://github.com/deadeye536/FPAutoUpdate/raw/master/FPAutoUpdate.user.js)

Installation
------------
Installation of this script is mostly straight forward, and instructions are available on [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/about/installing) either at the link here or under the "Install" button.

A few script-specific things you need to do in order to ensure operation of the userscript.
1. Access the script's settings by opening any thread and opening the "More" menu on the navigation bar.
2. In order to enable Chrome's desktop notifications, you must first allow facepunch.com to show desktop notifications. To do this, click on the "Desktop Notifications" check-box.
3. Refresh all your Facepunch tabs and you're done!

Compatibility
-------------
Currently, this exclusivly uses webkitNotifications API that is provided only by webkit-based browsers (Chrome, Chromium, and Safari (untested)). However, there appears to be a [Firefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/html-notifications/) which adds this functionality to Firefox. I am not responsible for this plugin or any side-effects of you installing it.
